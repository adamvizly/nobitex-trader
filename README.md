# nobitex-trader
a trader bot on Nobitex crypto exchange
this is a work of fiction and by any means is not advised to use with the money you need, see it as a educational project.
with that said to run the project you simply set your credentials in config.py file
and the market you want to trade in trader.py file like ```market = 'XLMIRT'```
you can use a few indicators implemented in strategy.py file or make your own strategy there and use it in trader.py
then you need to run trader.py and done!


***attention: this is not a complete project and needs some work to be able to use it.***
